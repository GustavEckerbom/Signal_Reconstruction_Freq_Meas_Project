# Project Overview
This project provides a simple initial test of both isolated and non-isolated UART ports. Additionally, it includes functionality to blink the user LED.

If you have trouble to get this project into the STM32CubeIDE the most straightforward way is to copy the .ioc file into a new folder where you want the project and open it in cubemx. Then generate a new project from cube MX with the toolchain set to stm32cubeide. This will generate a new project with the same settings as this one. Finally copy the content of the main.c file into the main.c file of the new project.
